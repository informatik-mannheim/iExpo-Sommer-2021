### Open Source CoronaTrackingTool developed by the University of Applied Sciences Mannheim

The goal of this project is to develop an open source contact tracking solution for public institutions, especially universities and colleges. Students can check into a room at the beginning of their lecture, using a QR code and their student mail. Non faculty members may be required to provide additional information to allow effective tracking in the case of an infection. The project was created around the principals of transparency and privacy. All gathered data is deleted automatically after the required period.
